<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.</p>

<p>We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
</ul>

<p>Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.</p>

<ul>
  <li>3, 34, 23432 Yes!</li>
</ul>

<p>Enter a sequence:</p>

<form action="">
  <label for="first">First number:</label>
  <input id="first" type="text" placeholder="The first number">
  <label for="second">Second number:</label>
  <input id="second" type="text" placeholder="The second number">
  <label for="third">Third number:</label>
  <input id="third" type="text" placeholder="The third number">
  <button>Check</button>
</form>
<hr>
<p>When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. <b>Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.</b></p>
<form action="">
  <label for="rule">Your answer:</label><br>
  <textarea id="rule" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea><br>
  <button>I think I know it</button>
</form>
