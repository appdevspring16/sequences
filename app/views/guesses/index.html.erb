<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>
  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.

<p>
  Here’s how it works:
</p>

<p>
  We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
</p>

<p>
We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>4, 2, 1 No.</li>
  <li>1, 2, 3 Yes!</li>
  <li>4, 2, 1 No.</li>
  <li>100, 10000, 1002 No.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Enter a sequence:

<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
  <label for="first">First number:</label>
  <input id="first" type="text" placeholder="the first number">

  <label for="second">Second number:</label>
  <input id="second" type="text" placeholder="the second number">

  <label for="third">Third number:</label>
  <input id="third" type="text" placeholder="the third number">

  <button type="button" name="button">Check</button>

When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. <strong>Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.</strong>
</p>

<form>
<label for="your_answer">Your answer:</label>
<div>
    <textarea id="your_answer" rows="10" cols="40"></textarea>
</div>

  <button>I think I know it</button>
