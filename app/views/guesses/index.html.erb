<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.</p>

<p>We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
</ul>

<p>Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.</p>

<ul>
  <li>8, 8, 8 No.</li>
  <li>8, 8, 8 No.</li>
  <li><%= @user_first %>, <%= @user_second %>, <%= @user_third %></li>
</ul>

<p>Enter a sequence:</p>

<form action="/all_guesses">
  <label for="first">First number:</label>
  <input name="first_number" id="first" type="text" placeholder="The first number">

  <label for="second">Second number:</label>
  <input name="second_number" id="second" type="text" placeholder="The second number">

  <label for="third">Third number:</label>
  <input name="third_number" id="third" type="text" placeholder="The third number">

  When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. <strong>Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.</strong>

<form action="/show_answer">
  <label for="your_answer">Your answer:</label>
  <div>
    <textarea name="rule" id="your_answer" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
