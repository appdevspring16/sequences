<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.</p>

<p>We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
</ul>


<p>Now it's your turn..</p>

<ul>
  <li>3, 6, 12 Yes!</li>
</ul>

<p>Enter a sequence:</p>

<form action="">
  <label for "first">First number:</label>
  <input id="first" type="text" placeholder="The first number">

  <label for "second">Second number:</label>
  <input id="second" type="text" placeholder="The second number">

  <label for "third">Third number:</label>
  <input id="third" type="text" placeholder="The third number">

  <button>Check</button>
</form>
