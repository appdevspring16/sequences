<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>
  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Here’s how it works:
</p>

<p>
  We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
</p>

<p>
  We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>15, 16, 17 Yes!</li>
  <li>1, 5, 8 Yes!</li>
  <li> 15, 16, 17 Yes!</li>
  <li>5, 3, 2 No.</li>
  <li>0, 0, 0 No.</li>
  <li>1, 2, 3 Yes!</li>
</ul>

<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
  <p>
    Enter a sequence:
  </p>
  <label for="first">First number:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" value="" placeholder="The first number">
  <label for="first">Second number:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" value="" placeholder="The second number">
  <label for="first">Third number:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" value="" placeholder="The third number">
  <button>Check</button>
</form>

  When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. <b>Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.</b>
